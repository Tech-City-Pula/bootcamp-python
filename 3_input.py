"""
In Python, the input() function is like asking someone a question and waiting for their response. When you use input(), the program pauses and waits for the user to type something on the keyboard and press Enter. Whatever the user types is then given back to the program as text (a string). For example, name = input("What is your name? ") asks the user to type their name and then stores it in the variable name.

name = input("what's your name?\n")

print("hello " + name)
