"""
Tuples in Python are like a tray with slots for different items; once you place an item into a slot, it can't be replaced or moved. You create a tuple by putting values inside parentheses (), separated by commas, like this: my_tuple = (1, 'apple', 3.14). Once you've created a tuple, you can't add to it or change its items, but you can use it to hold a collection of values that shouldn't change throughout the program. Accessing items in a tuple is similar to accessing items in a listâ€”you use the index number, like my_tuple[1] for 'apple'. Tuples are commonly used for data that is meant to stay constant.
