"""
Functions in Python are like little machines in a factoryâ€”each is designed to do a specific job. You give a function some information (we call these "arguments"), and it processes that information to do a task or calculate a result, which it can give back to you (this is called the "return value"). To create a function, you use the def keyword, followed by the function name and parentheses with any arguments inside. Functions help you organize your code and reuse it multiple times without repeating yourself.
