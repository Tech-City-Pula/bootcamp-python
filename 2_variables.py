"""
In Python, a variable is like a labeled jar where you can store information. You can put different types of things in this jar, like numbers, text, or even lists of items, and then use the label to refer to the contents later. You create a variable by choosing a name for it and using the equals sign = to store something in it. For example, my_number = 10 creates a variable named my_number and puts the number 10 in it.
