# Exercise 1: Ask the user for their name and their favorite color, then print a message saying "Hello [name], your favorite color is [color]."

name = input("what's your name?\n")
color = input("what's your fav color?\n")

print(f"Hello {name}, your favorite color is {color}")


# Exercise 2: Write a program that asks the user to enter two numbers, adds them together, and prints the result.

number_one = int(input("enter a number\n"))
number_two = int(input("enter another number\n"))

print(number_one + number_two)
# print("2" + "2")
# print(2 + 2)
