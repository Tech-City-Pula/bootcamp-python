"""
Classes in Python are like blueprints for creating objectsâ€”a class defines the shape and behaviors of all instances of that type. Imagine a class as a recipe that you can use to make similar yet distinct batches of cookies. Each batch, while made from the same recipe, can have unique characteristics like the number of chips or the size of the cookies. Classes bundle data and functionality together and are a fundamental part of Python's approach to object-oriented programming (OOP).
